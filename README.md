# Weather Forecasting - Hourly Temperature of Seattle City

Weather forecast is the branch of science to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for the given location and time. This is more relatable as this helps to plan everyday travel and other related activities. Weather warnings are the most important forecasts as they protect life and property from adverse damage. In this project, I have used hourly temperature data of the Seattle city and built a prediction model to forecast the upcoming temperature. I have made use of various time series model techniques like average method, naïve method, drift method, simple exponential smoothing, holts’ linear method, holts winter method and ARMA methods to build the prediction model. Also, I have performed multivariate regression analysis on the dataset to check the linear dependency of the target variable with the regressor. A comparative study is performed to determine the best model by evaluating the results of these models like MSE values, variance & mean of the predicted error & forecast error, Q value and chi square test results. Using this best model,the h step forecast is performed on the test set.
